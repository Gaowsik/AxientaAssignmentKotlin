Practice Test MVVM:

1.create a android project to get a response from this URL.       
      URL (GET):  Endpoint

2. save only the "articles" array to the SQLite table called "articles"

3. get values from that "articles" table and show only the "author, source name, title, urlToImage" values on a List view.

4. when you long click on an item, you need to popup a dialog box and ask to delete that item. If you click "yes", that item data will need to delete from the table and then refresh the list. If you click "no" then just dismiss the dialog box.
